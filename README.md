This video demonstrates hardware-bound encryption with runtime plaintext protection and physical security key confirmation.

### Features shown
- Runtime plaintext never exposed during active use
- Encryption bound to a specific hardware ID
- Physical security key confirmation (button presence required)
- External executable (EXE) file protection

### Overview
Bigvirtue1 Privacy Guardian God is an experimental encryption project focused on preventing plaintext exposure not only at rest, but also during runtime.
The design emphasizes hardware-bound security and physical presence verification to reduce the risk of remote compromise.

This project explores an alternative approach to conventional disk or container-based encryption by combining:
- Hardware identity binding
- Runtime protection mechanisms
- Optional physical security key interaction

### Status
- Public demo available
- Free release planned
- Documentation and binaries will be added incrementally
